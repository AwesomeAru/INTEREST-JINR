The OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus) experiment was conducted at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. It was designed to demonstrate the oscillation of muon neutrino into tau neutrino using nuclear emulsion technique. The experiment observed 10 tau neutrino candidate events, confirming the transmission of muon neutrino into tau neutrino during their flight from CERN to Gran Sasso. The transmission of muon neutrino into tau neutrino as seen during the experiment is due to the phenomena of neutrino oscillation which describes the change of flavour of the neutrino as it moves through space. We made use of the C++ and ROOT libraries to analyse experimental data gathered from the CERN Open Data Portal. For visualization of tau neutrino event, JavaScript, HTML and C++ were used.  

## Tasks
- Task 1: Analysis of Emulsion Data for the study of Neutrino-induced Charmed Hadron Production
- Task 2: Track multiplicity studies in νµ CC interactions
- Task 3: Visualization of the events from the OPERA emulsion dataset
